# Scan-Active-Network

 * From this task I had learnt about the tool wireshark and their workflow.
 * I had capture the transaction of network packets on the internet of some protocols.
 * SSL is the protocol also I captured and TCP, UDP, ARP, and DNS are the protocols I filtered in this task with some of their screenshots.
 * When I used to ping a google then it shows in DNS protocol.
 * Also we can filter by host address with the specified ports for the particular active network e.g., wlan0, eth0, wlp2s0 (USB Tethering) and etc,.
